You can already ask the first questions on top of your dataset, either by selecting it from the top right list of datasets, or by clicking on the "QUERY" button
under your profile.

For the "cocktails" dataset some example questions are already provided. This is not the case for another dataset, but by knowing your dataset you
will be able to formulate some first questions. Here some examples:

![Result_Parial0](/img/screenshots/Result_Partial0.png)

and

![Result_Parial1](/img/screenshots/Result_Partial1.png)

Note that for now there is no contextual information attached to the answers, like descriptions, external links, maps, images and videos. How this can be achieved
will be shown in [Part 6](/docs/doc1.6).

The results that you achieve may not be satisfying. To train the machine learning model to fit your dataset check the next section.
