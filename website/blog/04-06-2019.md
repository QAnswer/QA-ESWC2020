It took some time ... but we finished setting up a forum where people can ask questions related to QAnswer. You have a problem uploading your own dataset? You do
are searching for a particular API? The Machine Learining model does not converge to what you expected? The [QAnswer Community](/community) is the place
 to ask and get help. So if you are in this situation just make a post!
